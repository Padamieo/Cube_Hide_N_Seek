PROBLEMS:

- ent.moveDown and ent.moveUp are reversed you silly
- moveUp etc need to be moved into a component ("2D Velocity Based Movement")



Engine Design


Components Necessary (not necessarily implemented as objects):
	- Renderer
	- Entity Manager
	- UI manager
	- Texture Manager
	- Font Manager
	- Geometry Definitions
		-- Geometry Manager
	- Physics Engine
	- Game object; including state switching




Initial Intent:
	- 2D renderer only
	- 2D physics only
	- Texturing, spritesheets
	- App entry point: user-created app.js
		-- user will create app.js, defines project-specific logic
		-- user can override segments of the engine by passing functions to component "replaceMethod" functions
		-- user can extend functionality to modify any component
		-- app.js will contain *all* non-engine-standard functionality for a given project
	- Component-based Entities (Entity has core function, make available components for capabilities/behaviours/ai)


Future Intent:
	- 3D rendering support
	- 3D physics support
	- Mixed 2D + 3D support
	- Expansive AI behaviour presets including entry point for modification/extension
